Imagine this code is a recipe for creating a digital token on the Ethereum blockchain. Here's what it does:

Uses a pre-built oven: It follows a standard recipe (ERC20) established for creating tokens on Ethereum. This ensures things work smoothly.
Names the cake: The token is called "Metacrafter" with the abbreviation "MTAC."
Sets the portion size: The smallest unit of the token is considered a "decimal." There are only 100 total tokens to begin with.
Gives the baker the cake: The person who creates this token (the baker) gets all 100 tokens initially.
So, this code creates a limited supply (100 units) of a digital token named "Metacrafter" (MTAC) and gives them all to the person who deploys the contract.
